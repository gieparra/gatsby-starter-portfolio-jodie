Welcome to my web development portfolio. Each project reflects my holistic approach to web design, where strategy, architecture, and user experience (UX) come together to create seamless digital experiences. I specialize in front-end development, using HTML and CSS to build responsive, visually engaging websites. With a focus on clear design, thoughtful UX, and practical functionality, my goal is to craft sites that not only look great but also perform well, ensuring users can navigate with ease and efficiency.

### Project 1: Web Design for Agrosintesis
Here’s a brief look at my project for Agrosintesis, where I had the opportunity to redesign their website with a focus on clean, responsive design. I contributed to the site’s architecture by mapping out the structure, ensuring smooth navigation and intuitive user experience (UX). Additionally, I played a key role in the UX design, optimized photography, and led the editorial design to ensure consistency and clarity in the content. The result is a polished and functional website that reflects the client’s brand while enhancing user interaction.

### Project 2: Responsive Forms
This project was created during my FEWD Intermediate course, where I focused on building responsive forms using CSS. The project includes various form elements such as checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown menus, and input fields, all styled with attention to usability and aesthetics. Each form is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across different screen sizes and devices. The project highlights my skills in form design, layout management, and CSS responsiveness.

### Project 3: Website Navigation - Brake Free From Plastic
This project features a fully responsive website with a hamburger navigation menu that seamlessly adapts to different screen sizes. The navigation menu allows smooth transitions between pages, while SVG icons and inline images enhance the visual appeal of the content. The website focuses on raising awareness about plastic waste in the ocean, with a compelling hero section showcasing impactful background images. To ensure a consistent user experience across various devices, I utilized @media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes, making the site both functional and visually engaging.

### Project 4: CSS Gradiants - Black and White
In this project, I utilized CSS gradients to create a sleek black-and-white background that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes. The gradient design enhances the visual appeal of the site while maintaining a minimalist aesthetic. By using responsive CSS techniques, the background ensures an optimal viewing experience across devices, showcasing the versatility of gradients in web design.
