Welcome to my web development portfolio. As an emerging web designer, I am passionate about blending strategy, architecture, and user experience (UX) to craft clean and functional websites. I focus on front-end development, using HTML and CSS to create responsive and visually appealing designs. While I’m still building my experience, each project demonstrates my commitment to learning and applying the best practices in web development, with a strong focus on usability and design.


### Project 1: Web Redesign for Agrosintesis
Here’s a brief look at my project for **Agrosintesis**, where I redesigned their website with a focus on clean, responsive design. I worked on the architecture of their site map, the UX design and photography, I also did all the editorial design.

### Project 2: Portfolio Redesign
Another exciting project I worked on was redesigning my own portfolio. It was an excellent opportunity to improve my design skills and showcase my work with a fresh layout.
