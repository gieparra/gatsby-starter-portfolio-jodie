Here’s a brief look at my project for Agrosintesis, where I had the opportunity to redesign their website with a focus on clean, responsive design. I contributed to the site’s architecture by mapping out the structure, ensuring smooth navigation and intuitive user experience (UX). Additionally, I played a key role in the UX design, optimized photography, and led the editorial design to ensure consistency and clarity in the content. The result is a polished and functional website that reflects the client’s brand while enhancing user interaction.
