# About

I began my creative journey studying graphic design in Mexico, where I started my career in offset printing. During this time, I gained expertise in color separation, font sizes, and various printing formats—from business cards to booklets. I learned how to work with color and establish strong brand identities. Later, I transitioned to digital design and printing, working with real estate companies and local businesses.

My career took an exciting turn when I joined an entertainment company, creating publicity designs for events. This work ranged from digital designs to small and large printing formats, such as tickets and billboards. Eventually, I embarked on a freelance journey, offering my design services to small local businesses, professionals, and party planners. During this period, I also partnered with a friend to run a digital print shop in San Diego, where we collaborated with local business owners and realtors. This was a fantastic experience that allowed me to deepen my connection with the community.

A few years later, I worked under contract with a creative agency, which introduced me to content management systems (CMS). Following that, I spent six years with a Mexican agriculture magazine, where I honed my editorial design skills, managed the magazine's website, and even redesigned its architecture. Managing a site with over 15 years of content presented challenges, including technical glitches. Although my knowledge was limited at the time, this experience sparked a deep interest in web development.

Now, I am pursuing web development courses at San Diego College, embarking on a new and exciting journey in this field. I’ve fallen in love with coding and am eager to blend my design background with my growing technical skills.

## Personal Interests

Outside of work, I am a passionate food lover who enjoys exploring new flavors and occasionally cooking. Nature inspires me, and I find joy in activities like yoga and hiking. Music and video streaming are some of my favorite ways to unwind. I’m also an avid reader who enjoys diving into a variety of topics and going down research rabbit holes to satisfy my curiosity.
